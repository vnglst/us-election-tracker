  One person was killed after two masked gunmen opened fire during a service at a church in Istanbul on Sunday, Turkey’s Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya posted in a statement on X, formerly known as Twitter.
 
  The incident occurred in the district’s Büyükdere neighborhood around 11:40am local time (3:40aET) while the Santa Maria Church was holding a Sunday service, Yerlikaya said.
 
  A “large-scale investigation” has been launched and authorities are trying to find the two attackers, he added.
 
  “We strongly condemn this vile attack,” the minister said.
 
  The motive of the attack is unknown.
 
  Istanbul Governor Davut Gul said no one was injured in the attack, which he said targeted one person.
 
  Turkey’s Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc condemned the attack and said the Deputy Chief Public Prosecutor and two other public prosecutors had been assigned to investigate the incident.
 
  “Efforts continue to identify and capture the suspects who carried out the attack. The investigation is being carried out in a multifaceted and meticulous manner,” Tunc added.
 
  Turkish security forces with “all their resources” have been mobilized, said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
 
This is a developing story and will be updated.
