  In November 2004, Scott Peterson was convicted of murdering his wife, Laci, and their unborn son, Conner. Prosecutors alleged that Peterson’s motive for the murders was to escape married life and upcoming fatherhood. His death sentence was overturned in 2020, and he is serving a life sentence without parole. In January 2024, the Los Angeles Innocence Project, a non-profit that works to exonerate people who are wrongly convicted, announced it is representing Peterson as it investigates his “claim of actual innocence.”
