The latest developments in the U.S. elections include challenges faced by President Joe Biden from within his own party, primarily due to concerns over his age and handling of certain policies, particularly regarding Israel-Hamas conflict. A primary challenger, Minnesota Representative Dean Phillips, has based his challenge on Biden's age rather than ideological differences. On the Republican side, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley was a strong contender in the New Hampshire primary due to the state's history of favoring moderates and mavericks, but recent developments have yet to reveal how these challenges will impact the elections moving forward. Additionally, there are concerns about the potential intensity and duration of the campaign, with some expressing worry over the potential for increasingly extreme statements from both sides and its impact on voter turnout due to the extended nature of the contest.
