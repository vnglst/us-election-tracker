The latest developments in the U.S. elections include former President Donald Trump's eligibility to run for office again following his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol. A retired judge has recommended that Illinois State Board of Elections keep Trump on the ballot due to lack of statutory authority to remove him based on federal constitutional considerations. However, if the board believes it can review his eligibility under the 14th Amendment for engaging in insurrection, they should remove him. The decision is expected on Tuesday and can be appealed in Illinois state courts. Trump and his team argue he did not directly incite violence but engaged in an elaborate plan to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power following the election. Several voters have filed challenges against Trump based on his role in the insurrection, with some being dismissed on procedural grounds. A case in Colorado is currently pending appeal to the US Supreme Court.
