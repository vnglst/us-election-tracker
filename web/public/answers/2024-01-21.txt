There are concerns among Republican party officials about turmoil and dysfunction within several state Republican parties that could negatively impact their chances in key battleground states during the 2024 elections. Two state party chairs, one from Michigan and another from Florida, have recently been ousted from their positions amid investigations and internal disputes. Some local and national Republicans are considering bypassing state parties and relying on outside groups or their own organizations for funding and support. Former President Donald Trump's strong favorability ratings among Republican voters could make it difficult for his rivals to gain momentum. However, the primary season is still ongoing, with New Hampshire being the latest state to hold its primary, which may significantly influence the race.
