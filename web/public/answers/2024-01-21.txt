There are ongoing concerns within several state Republican parties regarding their dysfunction and turmoil, which could potentially impact the GOP's chances in the upcoming 2024 elections. Issues include financial problems, ideological clashes, personal scandals, and leadership disputes in states like Florida, Michigan, Arizona, and Georgia. Some local and national Republicans are considering bypassing state parties and working with outside groups instead. For instance, Michigan is embroiled in a lawsuit over party leadership and assets. Florida's former chairman was removed due to a sexual assault investigation. Nevada's chair and vice-chair were indicted for their involvement in a fake elector scheme during the 2020 presidential election. In Arizona, there have been disagreements over holding the state's presidential primary on one day in 2024 and securing sufficient funding. The Republican National Committee has been contacted by some state parties seeking financial assistance.
