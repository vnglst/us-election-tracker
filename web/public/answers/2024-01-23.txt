The latest developments in the US elections include former President Donald Trump's transformation of the Republican Party and his bond with voters. He has successfully leveraged legal dramas to fuel his campaign, and millions of Americans believe his falsehoods about a stolen election. In the GOP primaries, Trump has won significant victories in states like New Hampshire and Iowa, making it difficult for other candidates like Nikki Haley to gain momentum. Republicans appear to be focused on nominating Trump again as a way to seek vindication for perceived wrongs done to him.
