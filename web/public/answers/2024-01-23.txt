The Republican Party primary race in the U.S. has seen significant shifts since the last election cycle. Former President Donald Trump is currently leading the race, winning delegates in several states despite not having the majority of votes. He has capitalized on his legal dramas to fuel his campaign and driven out opponents, making him a frontrunner in key states. Nikki Haley, a potential rival, faces challenges in areas like South Carolina due to her absence from the ballot for over a decade and the state's strong pro-Trump sentiments. The dynamic of primaries has also changed with more open primary systems that incentivize reaching beyond partisan bases and focusing on issues, potentially reducing hyperpartisanship and polarization.
