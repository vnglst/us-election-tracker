Recently, the voting technology company Smartmatic accused One America News (OAN) executives of potentially engaging in criminal activities for obtaining and distributing a spreadsheet containing supposed passwords of Smartmatic employees. At the same time, OAN and other Trump supporters were aggressively promoting false claims of voter fraud and blaming Smartmatic for manipulation of votes in the 2020 election. Former Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell pleaded guilty to six misdemeanor crimes in Georgia's sweeping election subversion case, stemming from her attempts to breach voting systems and promote false fraud theories on various media outlets including OAN and Fox News. Both Smartmatic and the individuals involved deny these allegations.
