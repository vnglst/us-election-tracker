The latest developments in the U.S. elections include ongoing efforts to remove former President Donald Trump from the 2024 presidential ballot based on the 14th Amendment due to his attempts to overturn the 2020 election and his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection. However, challenges to remove him from the ballot in several states have been dismissed on procedural grounds. There are also concerns within the Republican Party over dysfunction and financial problems in several state parties, which could impact their chances in 2024. In Michigan, there is a fight for control of the party after Kristina Karamo was voted out as chair, while her supporters held their own vote to keep her in the position. In Florida, Christian Ziegler was removed from his job as chairman amid a sexual assault investigation.
