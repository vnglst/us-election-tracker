The latest developments in the U.S. elections include Vice President Kamala Harris touring key battleground states for reproductive freedoms, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's appearance in Milwaukee to promote President Biden's record, and the Biden campaign's infrastructure building and organizing efforts in Wisconsin. The campaign plans to deploy thousands of staffers by early summer and is facing tests as it shifts towards general election mode. Some Democrats have expressed concerns about the pace of battleground organizing, but the campaign expects to be operating at "full steam" by early summer.
