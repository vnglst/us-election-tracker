  England under-20 international Charlie Hughes gave new meaning to the phrase ‘late winner’ when he scored after 20 minutes of second-half stoppage time to earn Wigan Athletic a 1-0 win over Wycombe Wanderers in England’s third tier on Tuesday.
 
  The unusually long period of stoppage time at the end of the League One match came about because of an injury to referee Adam Herczeg after a fall early in the second half.
 
  Fourth official Steven Rushton replaced Herczeg on the pitch, but the restart was delayed while a search was conducted in the crowd at the DW stadium for a qualified fourth official.
 
  Both teams missed chances to take the lead after play resumed, but with the game seconds away from a goalless draw, a cross from Callum McManaman found center-half Hughes in the box.
 
  The England under-20 international caught the ball on the volley to score the latest goal recorded in a match in the long history of the English Football League (EFL) to win the game.
 
  The victory moved Wigan into the top half of League One standings, sitting 11th with 34 points. Wycombe is 17th on 30 points, four above the relegation zone.
 
  Portsmouth is the leader with 56 points.
