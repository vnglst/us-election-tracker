  Anthony Anderson fought a chair and lost.
 
  The actor got hurt on the set of his upcoming film “G20” in Cape Town, South Africa, and detailed the incident in a post on Instagram Thursday.
 
  “I spent the night in the emergency room,” he wrote, alongside a photo of himself on a stretcher. “Movie set fight gone wrong. Me against two goons and a chair! Guess who didn’t win!”
 
  He added that while he was receiving some medical care, he managed to escape the scene without any broken bones.
 
  “Who needs a stuntman? Me that’s who! I’m not as young as I used to be!” he wrote. “CT scan and X-rays showed nothing fractured or broken in my back just a deep contusion. That chair will never be the same though! Bloodied and bowed but never broken!”
 
  Comedian Loni Love commented on Anderson’s post, “Yo old axx know you need a stunt double…. Lawwddd… get well soon broke back.”
 
  Anderson’s former “Black-ish” co-star Tracee Ellis Ross wrote, “You are not made of rubber. Im so glad you are ok.”
 
  Television host Kevin Frazier simply said, “Stop fighting chairs.”
