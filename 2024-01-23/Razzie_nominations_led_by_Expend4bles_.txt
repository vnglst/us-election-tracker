  Mercenaries, a giant shark and a very scary version of Winnie the Pooh are among the central characters in the best of the worst in cinema as the nominees for the 2024 Razzies were revealed on Monday.
 
  Sylvester Stallone’s “Expend4bles” led with seven nominations, including worst picture, followed by “Exorcist: Believer,” with five nods.
 
  This year’s acting contenders feature former Oscar winners Jon Voight, Russell Crowe and Dame Helen Mirren, as well as Razzie “repeat offenders” Sylvester Stallone, Megan Fox and Jennifer Lopez.
 
The Golden Raspberry Awards (the formal name for the Razzies) celebrate the best of the worst in cinema. In keeping with its history, the “winners” are announced the day before the Academy Awards ceremony.
