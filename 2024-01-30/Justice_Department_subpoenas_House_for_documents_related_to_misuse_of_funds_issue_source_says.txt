  The Justice Department has issued a subpoena for documents to the Sergeant at Arms for the US House of Representatives.
 
  According to a source familiar with the matter, the subpoena involves a Democratic member and the misuse of funds surrounding security.
 
  The identity of the member was not immediately clear nor were additional details regarding the alleged misuse of funds.
